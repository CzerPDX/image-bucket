# Art Image Bucket (imitation S3)
This is a simple file storage service for [portlandredbird.com](https://www.portlandredbird.com/). It's designed to mimic the functionality of a cloud-based file storage service like Amazon S3, though it currently operates on the same server as the main site.

For use with regular webhost that can run node.js but provides similar interface to S3 so later transition will be smooth. Mainly provides an authenticated way for the uploading and deleting of images.
